Artificial intelligence is formally defined as an effort to machinize "intellectual tasks" usually performed by mankind.

Can computers think? Sure, with AI
- AI previously was just predefined set of rules.
- AI can be simple or complex.
- Example game for AI - chess, pacman, etc..
- Now, for any program to be considered AI, it needs to be simulating some intellectual human behaviour.

ML is a part of AI.

AI can be depicted in this manner: Data-> Analyze with the set of rules -> Output

ML figures out the rules for us taking in the data(both input and expected output or just input data).
